description: "[Date: 1601.] Conversation, as it was by the Social Fireside, in the\
  \ Time of the Tudors. or simply 1601 is the title of a short risqu√© squib by Mark\
  \ Twain, first published anonymously in 1880, and finally acknowledged by the author\
  \ in 1906.\nWritten as an extract from the diary of one of Queen Elizabeth I's ladies-in-waiting,\
  \ the pamphlet purports to record a conversation between Elizabeth and several famous\
  \ writers of the day. The topics discussed are entirely scatological, notably flatulence\
  \ and sex.\n1601 was, according to Edward Wagenknecht, \"the most famous piece of\
  \ pornography in American literature.\" However, it was more ribaldry than pornography;\
  \ its content was more in the nature of irreverent and vulgar comedic shock than\
  \ obscenity for sexual arousal.\nPrior to the court decisions in the United States\
  \ in 1959-1966 that legalized the publication of Lady Chatterley's Lover, Tropic\
  \ of Cancer, and Fanny Hill, the piece continued to be considered unprintable, and\
  \ was circulated clandestinely in privately printed limited editions.\n From Wikipedia\
